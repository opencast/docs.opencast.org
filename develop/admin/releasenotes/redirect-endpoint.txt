There is a new `POST /redirect/get` endpoint which will redirect a user to a given URL.
Note that it only supports redirect to URLs that "live" on the same server (relative URLs).
This is useful for external applications which can use it to implement
patterns like Post/Redirect/Get, for example in the context of an authentication scheme
in combination with the new `JWTRequestParameterAuthenticationFilter`.
