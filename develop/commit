    Update Editor to 2023-10-17 (#5340)
    
    The biggest (and most obvious) change is the graphical redesign, akin to
    #5318. Furthermore, this also makes the editor work with the changes to
    subtitles coming with Opencast 15.
    
    This goes into develop as most agreed that the redesign is too big of a
    change to release it as a minor version.
    
    Known major issues (may or may not be related to this release):
    - opencast/opencast-editor#1154
    - opencast/opencast-editor#1161
