    Docs: Add beginner guide for submitting issues (#5484)
    
    We have detailed information on how to deal with security issues, but no
    general guide for submitting issues. This aims to change that. The goal
    here is to add helpful information for people who have been told to
    "submit an issue", but only have a vague idea on what that entails and
    are inexperienced with the Github web interface.
