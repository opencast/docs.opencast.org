    Remove unnecessary dependencies (#5466)
    
    Opencast did not use removed dependencies, according to the Karaf
    console.
    
    Is this change still allowed in a release after a feature freeze? It
    could break Opencast because you can't test all possible configurations.
    It works for me ;)
