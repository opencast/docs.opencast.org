    Replace Solr Search with OpenSearch (#5597)
    
    This PR removes Solr (and all of its issues) and replaces it with
    Opensearch/Elasticsearch (yay, new issues!), unifying our indexing
    tools.
    
    To accomplish this:
    - We had to [remove the Feeds](a594019f82916a55d203efe3e518224bc8b50dab)
    - We [replaced Solr with
    Opensearch](a594019f82916a55d203efe3e518224bc8b50dab)
    - Notably, I did not include URL signing support with this. If this is a
    deal breaker we can work on it later.
    - We [updated Tobira's integration](dedb54c)
    - We [updated out Paella glue](25e76ac)
    - We [fixed other integrations with Search](c32aeb6)
    
    I've hit a few questions as I've reviewed this internally a bunch, so
    I'm going to copy those questions up here as an initial code review.
    
    If you have a real system with lots of workflows and series, and want to
    give this a spin, know that this does not need anything but the
    database, and the dublincore metadata files. You should be able to pull
    those out of production deployments and then test this in entirely
    separate systems.
    
    Todo list:
    ~- Release notes note indicating that a reindex of the search service is
    required.~
    
    Known, unfixable issues:
    - Paella tests rely on `develop.opencast.org` to serve the `search/*`
    endpoints in the format expected by this PR. This obviously will not
    happen until *after* this PR is merged. Paella tests can be verified
    locally by setting up Opencast to run on port 80, then `npm run dev` and
    `npx playwright test` after the npm script finishes booting.
    
    Closes #3921
