    Subtitles as tracks in transcription services (#4842)
    
    * Bring Amberscript transcription in line with subtitles as tracks
    
    Changes the Attach WOH for Amberscript Transcription to be more in line
    with the new subtitle rules. Particularly:
    - Only takes one target flavor now (instead of multiple). Is required.
    - Default output format is now vtt (via conversion).
    
    Due to lack of Amberscript access, this is not particularly well tested.
    
    * Bring Watson transcription in line with subtitles as tracks
    
    Changes the Attach WOH for Watson Transcription to be more in line
    with the new subtitle rules. Particularly:
    - Only takes one target flavor now (instead of multiple). Is required.
    
    Due to lack of Watson access, this is not particularly well tested.
    
    * Bring Google transcription in line with subtitles as tracks
    
    Only some changes to the documentation.
    
    * Bring Azure transcription in line with subtitles as tracks
    
    Changes the Attach WOH for Azure Transcription to be more in line
    with the new subtitle rules.
    
    Due to lack of Azure access, this is not particularly well tested.
    
    * Bring SpeechToText transcription in line with subtitles as tracks
    
    Changes the SpeechToTextWorkflowOperationHandler to be more in line
    with the new subtitle rules.
    
    * Generalize mediaPackageElement type in speech-to-text services
    
    For external speech-to-text services, Opencast would always attach the
    resulting transcript as an attachment. With this commit, the Attach WOHs
    can now set which MPE type they want, e.g. track.
    
    The Attach WOHs can now optionally take a desired type as a workflow
    config key (although they will only accept 'attachment' or 'track').
    The default type was changed from 'attachment' to 'track'.
    
    * Fix checkstyle
