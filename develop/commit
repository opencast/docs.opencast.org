    Make LTI "Custom role" configuration more configurable (#5312)
    
    Hi, this is my first contribution to this repository.
    
    * The problem:
    Current implementation of custom roles allows only one custom role also
    it only accepts string that are exactly equal to role name which can
    limit configurability.
    
    This pull request implements ability to define multiple custom roles and
    custom roles that need to be added for example:
    ```
    lti.custom_role_name.1=Instructor
    lti.custom_roles.1=ROLE_MOODLE_INSTRUCTOR
    
    lti.custom_role_name.2=Learner
    lti.custom_roles.2=ROLE_MOODLE_LEARNER
    
    -- Additionally theres regex support for matching roles --
    lti.custom_role_name.3=ims\/lis\/Administrator
    lti.custom_roles.3=ROLE_MOODLE_ADMINISTRATOR
    ```
