    Set publication variables in analyze-MP (#5419)
    
    Similar to #5243 except this creates variables that contain which
    publication channels are part of the media package. These new variables
    are not created by default.
    
    The use case for this was that I wanted to publish everything if the
    event wasn't published before, including encoding and all, but only
    merge specific assets into the publication if it existed. Here's a
    snippet if you want to test this for yourself:
    
    ```
        <operation
          id="include"
          description="Publish to Engage"
          if="NOT ${publication_engage_player_exists}">
          <configurations>
            <configuration key="workflow-id">partial-publish</configuration>
          </configurations>
        </operation>
    
        <operation
          id="include"
          description="Update Engage publication"
          if="${publication_engage_player_exists}">
          <configurations>
            <configuration key="workflow-id">partial-publish-generated-captions</configuration>
          </configurations>
        </operation>
    
    ```
    
    Since the other one went into 14.x I'm aiming this at that branch as
    well, but I can aim at develop instead if somebody disagrees.
    
    This also contains a small change to the docs that explains which WOHs
    can generate workflow variables, because I keep forgetting this.
