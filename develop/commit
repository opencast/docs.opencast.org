    Docs: Move "Localization" to "Participate" (#5483)
    
    The contents of "Localization" seem to be more in line with the other
    pages in "Participate", so moving it there makes sense to me.
    
    Also gets rid of the empty "Translators" page, only because it is empty.
    If you want to create a list of translators, go ahead.
