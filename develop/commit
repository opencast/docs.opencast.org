    Remove Entwine from Asset Manager API module (#5609)
    
    ~Attempt at finally getting rid of entwine dependencies in the asset
    manager. WIP, I'll see how far I can take this.~
    
    Removes all entwine imports from the `asset-manager-api` module. (Seems
    like I'm not getting to `asset-manager-impl` anytime soon). Entwine
    functionality is replaced with standard java library functionality where
    applicable.
    
    The goal of this PR is to get rid of our entwine dependencies in the
    asset manager. While we usually try to get rid of entwine in passing and
    try to avoid adding it anywhere if we can avoid it, entwine dependencies
    are nested deep in the asset manager and we won't get rid of them unless
    we target them directly (or just rewrite the whole thing).
    
    The goal of this PR is not to greatly improve upon code structure or
    readability. In fact, some parts are likely to look just as complicated
    as before. Still, I hope that overall this will make work with the asset
    manager easier in the future. And naturally, while the code is not
    necessarily improving, it should also not be getting worse than before,
    so please do complain if you think that is the case :)
