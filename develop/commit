    Replace AngularJS based login page (#6098)
    
    This patch replaces the AngularJS based login page. Since the code was
    extremely simple, this does not need any external libraries. A few lines
    of native JavaScript is sufficient to get the same functionality.
    
    This also simplifies the CSS quite a bit. Although, you could probably
    still do a better job if you redo this from ground up with modern CSS.
    But this should already be much simpler.
    
    The login page is now also somewhat responsive.
    
    Finally, this will cause the default credentials to be pre-filled into
    the login form if this is detected to be a test or development
    installation. Meaning, either this run on `localhost` or on a
    `opencast.org` domain.
