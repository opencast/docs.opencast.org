    Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Ke1sy"><code>@â€‹Ke1sy</code></a>! - 1.
    Added 'aria-activedescendant' for input and functionality to calculate
    it;</p>
    <ol start="2">
    <li>Added role 'option' and 'aria-selected' for option;</li>
    <li>Added role 'listbox' for menu;</li>
    <li>Added tests for 'aria-activedescendant';</li>
    <li>Changes in aria-live region:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    <li>the instructions how to use select will be announced only one time
    when user focuses the input for the first time.</li>
    <li>instructions for menu or selected value will be announced only once
    after focusing them.</li>
    <li>removed aria-live for focused option because currently with correct
    aria-attributes it will be announced by screenreader natively as well as
    the status of this option (active or disabled).</li>
    <li>separated ariaContext into ariaFocused, ariaResults, ariaGuidance to
    avoid announcing redundant information and higlight only current
    change.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
