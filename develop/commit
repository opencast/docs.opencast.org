    Update tag support for subtitles as tracks in Paella Player (#4624)
    
    * Update tag support for subtitles as tracks in Paella Player
    
    Since the Paella Player already supports subtitles as tracks,
    this merely adds some support for tags that will be
    used with subtitles in the future.
    
    This also drops anything dfxp related, support for
    subtitles as catalogs, and some unused
    translation strings.
    
    * Add translations for subtitle display in Paella
    
    Adds translation strings for the subtitle selection for "no language",
    "unknown language" and "automatically generated".
