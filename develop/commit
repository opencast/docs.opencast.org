    Hint at how to properly close issues with pull requests (#5257)
    
    Mentioning issues in your PR with some magic keywords can automatically
    close these issues when the PR is merged. We even hint at this in our
    PR-template already.
    
    However, GitHubs implementation of this does not work super well with
    our release/branching model. Specifically, it only works if the PR is
    merged into the default branch, which is `develop` in our case.
    
    It **can** be made to work in our situation if the magic phrases are
    mentioned in commit messages alternatively or in addition to the PR
    description, because we regularly forward merge the release branches.
    
    This patch adds a corresponding note about this to the documentation,
    and links it in the PR template.
