    Docs: Hide bot PRs in changelog (#5359)
    
    When looking through the changelog in the docs to see what has changed,
    most people will not care about the semi-automatic dependency updates.
    Instead, they pose a hindrance as they need to be mentally filtered out.
    
    This PR moves all dependabot PRs to the bottom of the version they
    appear in, and hides them away in a html dropdown.
