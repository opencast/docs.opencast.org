    Docs: Make Developer Overview page more verbose (#5486)
    
    There's but a single sentence of introduction on the landing page of the
    developer docs. This aims to change that, so users do not feel quite as
    lost.
    
    This also tries to provide a loose definition for the different
    sections, based on what should be in those sections, not what is
    actually in them.
