    Remove contributors from main pom.xml (#6048)
    
    This patch cleans up the main pom.xml file by removing the sections:
    
    - developers
    - contributors
    - mailinglists
    
    The reasoning behind this is, that these are pretty much unmaintained
    and we have the information elsewhere. Mailing lists are listed on
    opencast.org and in our documentation. Contributors are nicely listed on
    GitHub. More importantly, those don't have to be maintained manually,
    leading to several contributors being absent and my old IRC nick,
    employer, … still being listed there.
