    Fix Translation Updates (#5256)
    
    This patch fixes the workflow downloading translation updates from
    Crowdin and applying them to our codebase. There is a typo in one of the
    variables causing the workflow to be invalid:
    
        Invalid workflow file: .github/workflows/update-translations.yml#L41
    
        The workflow is not valid. .github/workflows/update-translations.yml
        (Line: 41, Col: 24): Unrecognized named-value: 'secret'. Located at
        position 1 within expression: secret.CROWDIN_TOKEN
