    Add subtitle stream support (#4959)
    
    This PR is structured into multiple commits, making it easier to review.
    
    Opencast, until now, does not handle subtitle streams as part of a
    track. This can lead to errors e.g. when inspecting uncommon subtitle
    formats. This PR extends the media package data structure with support
    for subtitle streams and adopts various WOHs and other components.
    Currently missing is an adoption into the External API as well as the
    Admin UI frontend (Admin UI API already sends out the info).
