    Add documentation on subtitles (#4627)
    
    * Add documentation on subtitles
    
    Adds a new documentation file about subtitles.
    
    * Add language code spec to docs
    
    Removes Todos from the subtitles docs, and adds the IETF
    BCP 47 language tag spec as the default we want to support.
    Most technical meeting folks were in favor of it, and
    my research indicates that this indeed seems to be best spec
    for our use case.
    
    * Fix OC version number in subtitles docs
    
    Since we missed OC14, it's now OC15.
