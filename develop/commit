    Adds the 'add-force-flavors' config to the publish-engage workflow (#4617)
    
    You can use this new configuration if the publish strategy 'merge' is
    activated. Elements with these flavors will be added to an existing
    publication without deleting or overwriting existing elements.
    
    For example, you can add a track with another resolution, without
    running the whole publishing workflow again.
