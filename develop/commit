    Add useful videos to documentation (#6144)
    
    Fixes #5962.
    
    Adds various talks and webinars to the opencast documentation. These are
    mostly introductory talks to a given topic, or relatively timeless
    guides to timeless topics.
    
    If you feel I missed a publicly available video recording that should
    definitely be included in the docs, shoot me the link and I'll try to
    fit it in.
