    Fix for event state when workflow is paused when rebuilding ES index (fixes #5868) (#5869)
    
    This fixes the following: when the elastic search index is rebuilt,
    events that have the last workflow in paused state are shown as
    "Finished" instead of "Paused". The paused state is an active state
    because there's a workflow that has not finished but the event cannot be
    set to finished.
    Fixes #5868
