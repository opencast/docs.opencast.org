    Extend Asset Upload Workflow for Captions (#5248)
    
    In accordance with the recent changes to subtitles in Opencast, captions
    need special handling when they're uploaded to an existing event, e.g.
    they must be cut. This extends the existing workflow to handle this use
    case.
    
    **Attention:** This change depends on #5243 and #5247 to work and should
    not be merged separately!
    
    Also contains a minor fix in another workflow.
