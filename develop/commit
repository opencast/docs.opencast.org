    Fix integration tests, distribution upload and demo server update (#6187)
    
    We switched to Java 17 and 23 on `develop`, but the integration tests
    and the distribution upload were still set to only happen for Java 11
    builds.
    
    This means that the “Test Opencast” workflow finished successfully, but
    the integration tests were skipped and develop.opencast.org did not get
    updated for a while now.
