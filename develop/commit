    Paella 7: Add default layout for unknown track flavours and multiple streams (#5121)
    
    The changes weaken the requirement of predefined flavours by providing a
    default layout named auto. The default layout works with any number of
    tracks and arbitrary flavours. The default layout is always selectable
    in the layout selector.
    
    The fix is more a hack, as the flavors are hardcoded and required in the
    layout configuration. Thus, the paella player is not designed for
    arbitrary flavors and multiple streams. In my opinion, this problem
    could be solved by removing the restriction of fixed/valid flavours in
    the paella core.
    
    Fix #5107
