    <ol>
    <li>Zoom into time range.</li>
    <li>Network panel redesign.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>New APIs</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>[<code>browserContext.on('weberror')</code>]</li>
    <li>[<code>locator.pressSequentially()</code>]</li>
    <li>The [<code>reporter.onEnd()</code>] now reports
    <code>startTime</code> and total run <code>duration</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deprecations</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The following methods were deprecated: [<code>page.type()</code>],
    [<code>frame.type()</code>], [<code>locator.type()</code>] and
    [<code>elementHandle.type()</code>].
    Please use [<code>locator.fill()</code>] instead which is much faster.
    Use [<code>locator.pressSequentially()</code>] only if there is a
    special keyboard handling on the page, and you need to press keys
    one-by-one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Breaking Changes: Playwright no longer downloads browsers
    automatically</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>[!NOTE]
    If you are using <code>@playwright/test</code> package, this change
    <strong>does not</strong> affect you.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Playwright recommends to use <code>@playwright/test</code> package
    and download browsers via <code>npx playwright install</code> command.
    If you are following this recommendation, nothing has changed for
    you.</p>
