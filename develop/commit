    Add captions as standard upload option in Admin UI (#4623)
    
    * Add captions as standard upload option in Admin UI
    
    This changes subtitles in the asset upload from attachments to tracks
    and adds a subtitle upload to the source tab in the Admin UIs "Create
    Event" dialog.
    
    Furthermore, adds tag support to the asset upload. One can now add
    multiple tags to their asset upload configuration.
    
    Known issues:
    - Adding multiple options for uploading subtitles (for e.g. multiple
      languages) does not currently work. This is due to tracks in the same
      flavor being overwritten.
    
    * Add note about tags to config file
    
    Makes a comment about tags as a configuration value in
    event.upload.asset.options.properties.
    
    * Set generator to consistently to "unknown"
