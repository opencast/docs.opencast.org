    <h2>Browser Versions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Chromium 128.0.6613.18</li>
    <li>Mozilla Firefox 128.0</li>
    <li>WebKit 18.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This version was also tested against the following stable
    channels:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Google Chrome 127</li>
    <li>Microsoft Edge 127</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.46.0</h2>
    <h2>TLS Client Certificates</h2>
    <p>Playwright now allows to supply client-side certificates, so that
    server can verify them, as specified by TLS Client Authentication.</p>
    <p>When client certificates are specified, all browser traffic is routed
    through a proxy that establishes the secure TLS connection, provides
    client certificates to the server and validates server certificates.</p>
    <p>The following snippet sets up a client certificate for
    <code>https://example.com</code>:</p>
    <pre lang="ts"><code>import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
    <p>export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    use: {
    clientCertificates: [{
    origin: 'https://example.com',
    certPath: './cert.pem',
    keyPath: './key.pem',
    passphrase: 'mysecretpassword',
    }],
    },
    // ...
    });
    </code></pre></p>
    <p>You can also provide client certificates to a particular <a
    href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-use">test
    project</a> or as a parameter of <a
    href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context">browser.newContext()</a>
    and <a
    href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequest#api-request-new-context">apiRequest.newContext()</a>.</p>
    <h2><code>--only-changed</code> cli option</h2>
    <p>New CLI option <code>--only-changed</code> allows to only run test
    files that have been changed since the last git commit or from a
    specific git &quot;ref&quot;.</p>
