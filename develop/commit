    Remove prepared flavor (#5862)
    
    This removes the `prepared` flavor from the workflows and configuration
    as it currently serves no purpose and causes issues like making it hard
    to know which captions to update. It was initially introduced to archive
    the output of `prepare-av`, but that step was removed during the rework
    f the workflows. This would make #5598 obsolete.
    
    Might still be able to go into OC 16?
