    Return ISO 639 language code for language detected by Whisper (#5351)
    
    When Whisper uses language detection, it returns the language name in
    English instead of the ISO 639 code for some reason. But we need the
    latter for the language tag of the track. This makes an attempt to
    translate the language name in English to a matching two-letter language
    code using locales.
