    Skip elements during search-index rebuild that throw a NotFoundException (#6170)
    
    If during a rebuild of the search-index a NotFoundException is thrown,
    right now the rebuild will just stop and not process any more events. So
    in a cluster with a lot of events it is enough if there is one broken
    mediapackages in the system (for example caused by a faulty retraction,
    missing dublincore etc.) to not be able to continue the rebuild.
    
    With this patch instead of throwing a NotFoundException and stopping the
    process, the error gets logged and the element is beeing skipped, so
    that the rebuild can finish regardless.
