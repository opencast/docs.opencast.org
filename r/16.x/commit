    Defaults should be commented out (#5918)
    
    This PR comments out a default that should have been commented out but
    was left uncommented accidentally. Also fixed a spelling mistake I
    missed with #5909 relating to opencast/opencast-admin-interface#660
    
    TODO: There are a number of *other* defaults which are not commented
    out...
