    Mark old admin interface configuration as deprecated (#5915)
    
    This patch moves all configuration only affecting the old admin
    interface to the bottom of the configuration file and marks them as
    deprecated.
    
    This doesn't mean that they can't be used in the future if certain
    features are re-implemented. But for now, they just don't do anything.
    
    To help identifying if properties are used in the new admin interface I
    used the following script (and made sure they are also not used in
    Opencast's backend code):
    
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    
    sed -n 's/^#\{0,1\}prop\.\([^ =]*\)[ =].*$/\1/p' org.opencastproject.organization-mh_default_org.cfg \
    | while read prop
    do
      (
      cd ../../opencast-admin-interface/
      if grep -rnql "$prop" src
      then
        printf '%4s  %-60s %s\n' yes "${prop}" "used by admin interface"
      else
        printf '%4s  %-60s %s\n' no  "${prop}" "not used by admin interface"
      fi
      )
    done
    ```
