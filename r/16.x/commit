    Adjust `created` field of Tobira harvest response for events (#5863)
    
    This changed in OC 16 with the Solr/Opensearch swap as far as I can see,
    but it needs to be in a specific format in order to be harvested by
    Tobira. (Edit: I am referring to this commit:
    https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/5880526444317ea9396c97f4fa876480b83cd09d)
    
    No version bump since this only restores old behaviour and is not a
    breaking change.
