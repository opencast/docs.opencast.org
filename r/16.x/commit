    Fix search REST bugs (#5852)
    
    This PR fixes a couple of things:
    
    - af53424532 **Special handling for series and episode modification
    dates.**
    - ff824e951f **Harmonizing search behaviour between series ID and series
    names when searching for episodes. When searching with a series ID, if
    there is no matching series then no episodes get found. Prior to this
    commit you would get the full episode list when searching by series name
    when there is no matching series name. This commit makes the endpoint
    return an empty list when there is no matching series name.**
    - 35950b2b3d **Handling deletion of non-existent series. Honestly not
    sure how this would happen at all, but this adds handling for it at
    least.**
    
    Fixes #5834
    Fixes #5835
