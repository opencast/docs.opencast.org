    Sign urls in search rest service again (#6094)
    
    closes #5957
    
    Since the search rest service doesnt sign urls anymore, the engage
    player wont work when signing is required for all urls. This PR adds url
    signing again to the search rest service and therefore reintroduces the
    `sign` parameter, having the default to true.
