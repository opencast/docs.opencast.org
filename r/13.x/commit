    Add option to pass additional args to Whisper (#5342)
    
    This allows us to pass additional arguments to Whisper without having to
    deal with every single option separately.
    
    For example, I'm using this to pass the location for the model to
    Whisper with `--model_dir`, since at least whisper-ctranslate2 defaults
    to the home directory of the user... but if your user doesn't have a
    home directory, this doesn't work. This is also the reason I'm aiming
    this at 13.x, though this might be controversial.
