    Add config-keys to set minimum rules for cuts and segments duration (#5317)
    
    The editor WoH that applies the Opencast Built-in editor has some hidden
    configurations that are not user reachable.
    
    These configurations are:
    
    - Minimum segment duration: If a segment has a lower duration as this
    parameter, it will be discarded.
    - Minimum Cut segment duration: If the cut between two segments is less
    than the threshold, it will be discarded.
    
    The PR adds these two parameters to the
    `etc/org.opencastproject.videoeditor.impl.VideoEditorServiceImpl.cfg`
    file.
    
    Ready for Review
    
    ~~It will keep as a draft because I need to fix this undesirable log
    message:~~
    
    ```
    2023-10-06 15:07:15,981 | WARN  | (LoadUtil:95) - No hosts found that can process jobs of type segments.min.duration with load 100.0

    ```
    
    ~~That error is because I used the same method to read the properties as
    `jobLoad` variable. I will fix it soon.~~
