    Paella 7: Use the localstorage to store the user preferences and upgrades Paella core to 1.43 (#5253)
    
    This PR updates the paella to last version and updates the config file
    to save the user preferences in the localstorage instead of cookies.
    Fixes a "HTTP 431 header too large" bug when user's preferences are too
    large.
