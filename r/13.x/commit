    Fix update translations workflow (#5475)
    
    The update translations workflow always reaches three release branches
    into the past to ensure all edge cases are covered. That means `r/15.x`,
    `r/14.x` and `r/13.x` are updated right now.
    
    Unfortunately, `r/13.x` still has a now invalid Crowdin configuration
    which causes the workflow to fail. This will continue until mid 2024.
    
    See
    https://github.com/opencast/opencast/actions/workflows/update-translations.yml
    
    That's annoying and therefor, this pull request updates the
    configuration in `r/13.x` to ensure the update does not fail any longer.
