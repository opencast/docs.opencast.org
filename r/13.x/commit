    Ensure workflows have an associated org after upgrade (#4684)
    
    Repair in the WorkflowServiceImpl rather than the database.
    This makes the logic less hidden, and can use the AM's snapshot's org
    rather than relying on the (potentially incorrect) org ID from the
    security service.
