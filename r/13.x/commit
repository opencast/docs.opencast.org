    Reduce number of snapshots taken in the new editor backend
    
    In the new editor backend, various functions would create snapshots if
    run, e.g. the "Save subtitles"-function would create one and then the
    "Save thumbnails"-function would create one as well. This changes
    behaviour so that a snapshot is only taken once after all the
    potentially snapshot worthy changes have been made.
    
    Does not solve the problem of metadata having their own endpoint for
    saving, and thus causing another snapshot.
