    Update ES index before triggering event handlers from AssetManager (#5260)
    
    The event handler for live events will trigger another snapshot if
    something in the live publication changed. If we do the Elasticsearch
    update afterwards, this means the update happens for the new snapshot
    first, then for the old one, resulting in a lost update. This was broken
    when this part was changed to be synchronous instead of asynchronous in
    #3100.
