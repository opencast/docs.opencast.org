    Get thumbnail for editor frontend from archive (#5354)
    
    Intends to fix https://github.com/opencast/opencast-editor/issues/1154
    
    When generating a thumbnail in the editor frontend, saving it and then
    reloading the editor, the generated thumbnail would not show up. This is
    because thumbnails are loaded from the internal publication, but the
    generated thumbnails are only saved to the archive.
    
    This changes it so that thumbnails are loaded from the archive. If they
    cannot be found there, they are loaded from the internal publication
    instead.
