    Fixing firefox source in GHA/CI builds.  Ubuntu 22.04 lies about whether
    it's actually installing firefox by default, instead installing a script
    which tells you to install it from snap.  This doesn't work in several
    cases, so we're switching to a valid repo which provides proper debian
    packaging.
    
    Fixes: #4473
