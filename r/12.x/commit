    Make event updating faster after changes to series metadata/ACL
    
    When there are changes to a series metadata or ACL, all events
    belonging to that series need to updated as well. Currently, updating
    events takes a very long time.
    
    This commit decreases the time required for updating somewhat by
    increasing the polling interval with which Opencast checks if an
    updating job has completed. From the default 5 seconds to 100 milli-
    seconds.
