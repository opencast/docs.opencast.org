    Fix template losing user role when creating an event in the admin ui
    
    A non-admin user creating an event/series through the create dialog in
    the admin ui may accidentally remove his own role from the event because
    selecting a template in the access policy tab will lose the users role,
    thereby making them unable to access the event. This fixes that.
