    Switch to docker compose (#6088)
    
    The command `docker-compose` has been deprecated for a while and seems
    to finally be broken now:
    
    ```
    Run docker-compose up -d
      docker-compose up -d
      shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
      ...
    /home/runner/work/_temp/c5c18e1f-32e8-4962-bd06-9bbdb4895343.sh: line 1: docker-compose: command not found
    ```
    
    This patch switches to using `docker compose` instead.
