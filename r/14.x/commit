    Extend analyze-mp for tag variables (#5243)
    
    This extends the analyze-mediapackage WOH so it can also create
    variables containing whether elements with a specific flavor and tag
    exist, for example `captions_source_hastag_archive`. This allows this
    information to be used in workflow execution conditions.
    
    These variables aren't created by default (because there can be a lot of
    them), but only when `set-tag-variables` is true.
