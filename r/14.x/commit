    Fix/improve parts of the Tobira harvest API (subtitles & duration) (#5345)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira/issues/960
    Fixes https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira/issues/884
    
    Look at the commits for more information.
    
    Note: I was not able to test with events that actually contain
    subtitles! Since @KatrinIhler asked for this (for Bern), it would be
    very very cool if you could test this. In particular, whether it fixes
    the issue you had.
    
    And if @Arnei has time to take a look at this, I'd be interested in
    whether you see any problems with my "find subtitles" logic (second
    commit).
