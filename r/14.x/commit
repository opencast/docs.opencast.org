    Disable running Firefox from Karma on Macs (#5551)
    
    The old admin UI is on its way out anyway, so it should be fine to close
    #3894 with this. Karma is deprecated anyway, so if we want to fix it
    properly, we would need to get a new (frontend) test runner in there,
    which I don't see happening.
    
    Note for reviewers: There are two commits here, which are best viewed
    individually. The first just fixes some formatting issues in the Karma
    config. Or you view the the changes with whitespace ignored, that should
    also hide most (not all) of those "irrelevant" changes.
