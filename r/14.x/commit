    Encoding profile fix for portrait videos (#5548)
    
    Resolution based encoding for delivery videos in portrait format is
    broken. Example given
    
    Input video resolution | Maximum output video resolution
    -----------------------|--------------------------------
    1920x1080 | 1920x1080
    1080x1920 | 2160x3840
    
    We want not upscale videos per default. This patch fixes this.
