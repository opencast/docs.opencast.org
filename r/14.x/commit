    Merge branch 'r/13.x' into r/14.x
    
    * r/13.x: (22 commits)
      Add Opencast 13.8 release notes
      Make external api listprovider endpoints more general
      Properly formatting the json being sent over the wire
      Increase index rebuild logging frequency for batches
      Tobira endpoint may or may not be there, and that may change at runtime.
      Adding an updated date to the Tobira stats so we know when we last heard from Tobira.
      Addressing nullpointer and review comment
      Tobira data is sent as part of the stats data.  It's not quite sent the way we're presenting it here, but otherwise we have to make a bunch of extra UI changes, and this presents the data in (arguably) a clearer way.
      Remove limit and offset query parameters
      Add endpoint to get languages & licenses
      Allow ltitools to handle non-160/90 thumbnails
      Allow engage ui to handle non-16/9 thumbnails
      Allow deletion of reference users from the Admin UI
      Dont copy media files to new scheduled event
      Fix tainted canvas in editor thumbnail extractor
      Putting data and stats ID into separate structures to maintain separation between data sources.
      Using the request body, rather than form fields
      Properly handling the case wher Tobira has not reported yet
      Exporting required package
      Removing unncessary ReferencePolicy bits.  Adding missed dependency to the Tobira module.
      ...
