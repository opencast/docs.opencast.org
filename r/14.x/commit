    Update Stud.IP User Provider (#5231)
    
    This patch fixes a number of minor issues in the Stud.IP user provider:
    
    - Errors handled were actually copied over from the Moodle user
    provider. Changed the code to handle errors from Stud.IP.
    - Removed the unnecessary check if roles are `null`. The object `roles`
    can never be `null`.
    - Properly handle non-existing users. In that case, Stud.IP should
    return `404 Not Found`,
    - Add email address to users.
    - Fix some logging issues.
