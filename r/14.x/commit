    Fix ACL template selection breaking after first selection (#5537)
    
    The template selection dropdown for access policies in e.g. the event
    details is broken. After selecting an access policy, when trying to
    select another access policy, the rules from the access policy above the
    selected access policy will be selected.
    For example, if you have `public, authenticated, private` and select
    `public`, you get the aces for `public`. If you then select
    `authenticated` you get the aces for `public`. Then selecting `private`
    will lead to an error.
    
    This fixes that. Apparently the angularjs select thingy breaks if you
    set ng-model to a value that is not in ng-options (e.g. setting it
    ng-model to `0`, but ng-options only contains `951, 952, 953`). This
    commit sets it to `undefined` instead, which angularjs seems to be able
    to handle.
