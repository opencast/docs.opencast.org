    Fix Paella Player 7 login redirect (#5481)
    
    Our code for the Paella Player 7 checks the user role to decide whether
    to redirect to the login page. However, the user role can be different
    if you have configured a different user role prefix or simply turned
    sanitize off. A safer assumption seems to be to expect any logged-in
    user to have ROLE_USER.
