    Add support for custom actions in ACL to Tobira harvest API (#5492)
    
    Previously, only read and write roles were transmitted.
    
    This can go into 14 as it is not a breaking change. Well, one thing
    changes: `ROLE_ADMIN` is not explicitly included in the event ACL
    anymore. But since this is not a public free-for-all API, but only used
    by Tobira, and since Tobira has implicit `ROLE_ADMIN` checks everywhere,
    this is no problem. In fact, Tobira even removes `ROLE_ADMIN` in the
    incoming ACL before storing it in the DB.
