    Fix Paella Player 7 for single stream videos (#5539)
    
    Currently if we open the Paella Player 7 for an event that has only one
    track (careful: captions count as tracks!), we get an error "s.some is
    not a track". This was broken by the isLive check from #5420 and happens
    because a single track is not wrapped in an array when the episode is
    returned by the search service. This fixes that by doing that first. It
    won't win any awards for being pretty, but it works. ;)
