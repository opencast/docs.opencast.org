    Paella 7: Hide/Show timeline bar on live events (#5420)
    
    Paella player used to start playing live streams from the beginning of
    the buffer, so in case the stream had a time buffer, paella started
    playing from the beginning of the buffer and not from the current
    moment.
    
    This PR updates paella to version 1.46.1 that fixes that bug and also
    adds a property to the configuration file that allows to show or hide
    the time bar in live events.
