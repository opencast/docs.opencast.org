    Refix the CLA check (#6256)
    
    This PR fixes the CLA check so that it works properly. For some reason
    ubuntu-latest is *not* ubuntu 24.04 in October '24, instead we get
    ubuntu 22.04 which does not support `--break-system-packages`.
    
    This should be in `r/15.x` since it affects the branch (with the
    original fix being merged a couple of weeks ago). While we're not
    expecting significant contributions at this point, we should have the
    CLA checking in place regardless.
