    Whisper transcription engine bug fixing (#5436)
    
    This patch fixes a number of minor bugs and inconveniences in the
    whisper transcription engine. This includes loading of default values
    when the configuration has been modified which incorrectly kept their
    old values in some cases. It also does proper debug logging, not
    filtering out the actual output, which is what you want for debugging.
