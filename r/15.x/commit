    Add new Workflow Operation: Subtitle Timeshift (#5913)
    
    This PR adds a new Workflow Operation named: 'Subtitle Timeshift'.
    
    With this Workflow Operation we define the flavor of a subtitle track
    and the flavor of a video track. The workflow operation will then shift
    all timestamps of the subtitle file by the duration of the video.
    
    Use Case: Currently if you put a bumper/intro video in front of an
    already subtitled presenter track, the captions will mismatch. You can
    use this workflow to shift the times of the subtitle file by the
    duration of the bumper/intro video and the captions will match again.
    
    To test this, first generate subtitles with the `speech to text`
    operation. You can find a partial-publish workflow with the added
    operation in the
    [attachment](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15775191/workflows.zip).
    Then, create a theme with a bumper video in the admin ui and create a
    series that uses the theme. Add the new `subtitle-timeshift` operation
    in your workflows that looks like this:
    
    ```
        <operation
          id="subtitle-timeshift"
          description="Create new captions with time offset">
          <configurations>
            <configuration key="subtitle-source-flavor">captions/source</configuration>
            <configuration key="video-source-flavor">branding/bumper</configuration>
            <configuration key="target-flavor">captions/shifted</configuration>
          </configurations>
        </operation>
    ```
    
    But you can also use my `partial-theming`workflow, that I added to the
    [attachment](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15775191/workflows.zip)
    and adjust it.
    As the last step, create an event and don't forget to select the series.
    When the event is processed, the video should have the intro/bumper
    video in front of it and the captions should match the audio.
    
    If you use my workflows, please always use new created events for your
    tests. The workflows don't consider every possible combinations of
    handling subtitles.
    
    This new operation also works for trimmed captions. When you cut for
    example, use the schedule and upload workflow and uncheck the "straight
    to publish" option. When processed, cut your video and publish it. The
    captions should also match.
