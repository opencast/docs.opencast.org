    Display state mappings in the status column again (#5970)
    
    The events table in the admin ui has a status column that informs users
    about the current state of the latest workflow. A workflow can define
    "state mappings" to overwrite what is usually displayed. For example, a
    delete workflow may overwrite the usual "Running" with "Deleting". This
    has probably been broken since Opencast 12-ish, and this commit should
    fix it.
    
    Example:
