    Change segment `startTime` from mpeg7 to milliseconds in Tobira API (#5858)
    
    All durations in the API are transmitted as milliseconds, so this should
    be too. On the Tobira side we want to save it as milliseconds too, since
    Paella wants that anyway.
    
    This is a breaking API change and the API was already released as OC
    15.5, so why no API version bump? The Tobira API is declared internal
    and only to be used by Tobira. And Tobira did not use it yet! So nothing
    can break.
