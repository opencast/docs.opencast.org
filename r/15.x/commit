    Fix tobira harvest acls (#6157)
    
    An ACL can contain `allow` and `deny` rules; until now, all roles were
    added to the action to roles map, which only represents the allowed
    actions.
    
    This has led to users seeing videos in Tobira for which access has been
    denied.
    
    This can be tested by updating the series acl via /series endpoint and
    republishing the acl.
    
    **POST /series/{seriesID:.+}/accesscontrol**
    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <acl xmlns="http://org.opencastproject.security">
      <ace>
        <role>ROLE_USER</role>
        <action>write</action>
        <allow>false</allow>
      </ace>
      <ace>
        <role>ROLE_USER</role>
        <action>read</action>
        <allow>true</allow>
      </ace>
      <ace>
        <role>ROLE_USER_TEST</role>
        <action>read</action>
        <allow>true</allow>
      </ace>
      <ace>
        <role>ROLE_USER_TEST</role>
        <action>write</action>
        <allow>true</allow>
      </ace>
    </acl>
