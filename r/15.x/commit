    Don't create composites for new editor (#5556)
    
    The new editor can display more than one track and it's default in OC
    14, so there's no need to create composites for the internal publication
    anymore. But since lots of people still use the old one, I simply
    commented out the other operations. This might be debatable. I'm also
    unsure if this can go into a minor release - but config isn't updated
    automatically, right?
